When contributing to Cobra, please keep the following in mind:

1. Document your code. We use YARD to generate documentation written in the Markdown markup.
2. KISS, if your code looks too complicated, it probably is.
3. TEST EVERYTHING! Run `rspec` on your codebase before committing as these are the same tests that our CI system will run.
4. Don't bump your PR requests. If you submitted it, we've seen it and will get to it as soon as we can.
